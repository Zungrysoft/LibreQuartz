= Freedoom project news

0.11.3 (2017-07-18)::
  * Builds with DeuTex 5.0 and newer.

0.11.2 (2017-03-15)::
  * Missing multiplayer starts have been added to several levels.
  * A few mapping errors were repaired by changing sector heights.
    Speedrunners can better appreciate smooth flow through the levels.
  * Easy and normal difficulty levels have been tweaked.
  * Par times for _Phase 1_ have been added.
  * Cleaned up the title screen using the _Freedoom_ font for “Phase
    1” and “Phase 2” on-screen.

0.11.1 (2017-02-22)::
  * 1% armor bonus picks are recolored from red to green.  They were
    too easily confused for health pickups.
  * New _TNT: Evilution_ compatible textures.
  * New pain bringer and pain lord sprites, replacing old concept
    art-derived ones.
  * A few mapping errors are fixed, including misaligned textures,
    leftover Boom specials, and it should no longer be possible to get
    stuck between a rock and a tree in _Phase 1_ C1M1.
  * Brand-new _Phase 1_ C3M1, replacing the old _Doom_-inspired level.
  * Widescreen statusbar for ZDoom removed.  This created
    incompatibility with some mods.

0.11 (2017-02-16)::
  * _Freedoom_ is now a limit-removing game rather than using Boom
    specials.
  * Lots of new music.
  * New levels, including a new C1M1 for _Phase 1_.
  * Aquatex: over 200 new textures for mappers to use.
  * New intermission screens.
  * Some new weapon sprites: new pistol and new pickups.
  * New medkit and armor pickup sprites.
  * New project logo

0.10.1 (2015-12-23)::
  * Repairs an incompatibility in _Phase 1_ C3M7 with Boom 2.02.
  * Fully-completed sprite set for the flame bringer.

0.10 (2015-12-16)::
  * Brand new status bar.
  * New sprites for the serpent and orb monsters.
  * New HUD graphics for the single- and double-barreled shotguns,
    missile launcher, and SKAG-1337.
  * New pain sounds for many monsters and the player.
  * New maps in _Phase 1_ and _Phase 2_.

0.9 (2014-10-14)::
  * New file names that no conflict with _Doom_’s
  ** +freedoom1.wad+ is _Freedoom: Phase 1_ -- compatible with _The
     Ultimate Doom_.
  ** +freedoom2.wad+ is _Freedoom: Phase 2_ -- compatible with _Doom
     II_ and _Final Doom_.
  * _FreeDM_ and _Phase 1_ have grown out of the shadows of the
    project and have seen rapid advances, largely led by Xindage, our
    prominent Brazilian contributor.
  * New text font from Mechadon to replace the old one in all menus,
    in-game text, and status-bar HUD.
  * New zombie, shotgun zombie, and assault tripod sprites by a
    skilled pixel artist, raymoohawk.
  * New sounds for the dark soldier by jewellds.
  * More complete support for _Final Doom_ mods, adding many more
    textures missing to support mods for both _TNT: Evilution_ and
    _The Plutonia Experiment_, thanks to fraggle and AXDOOMER.

0.8 (2014-01-01)::
  * _Ultimate Freedoom_’s episode 4 is now the Cacoward-winning _Double Impact_.
  * Many maps have been updated
  * Improved sprites and sounds
  * _FreeDM_ is now vanilla-compatible and has quite a few new maps.
  * A BEX file is included in the IWADs, which allows compatible
    source ports to replace many strings in the game, such as level
    names, weapon pickups, and intermission text.
