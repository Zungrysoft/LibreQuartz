For Phase 1 and 2, do not have a multiplayer demo in the DEMO1 slot.
Vanilla Doom (and some source ports) do not allow using the “load
game” option while in a network game, and network game demos count as
such.  The other three demo slots are fair game, since they do not
near-immediately block out the load game functionality when starting
Freedoom.

FreeDM is exempted since it is not intended to be a single-player
game.
