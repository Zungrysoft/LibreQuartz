Info
================================================================================

Since Inkscape can't link entities between svg files,
I had to use colour images (/textures).

To batch export tga images from the svg files,
I wrote the export.sh, export_newversion.sh and png-tga.scm scripts.
(Requires vi, Inkscape and Gimp. Put the Gimp script in ~/.gimp*/scripts/)
