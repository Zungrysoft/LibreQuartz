1. Description

qME is a 3D Modeller, Animator, 3D painter and 2D Texture editor for Quake 
MDL files. MDL files contain models of monsters, weapons and other items 
that are used in Quake.

The following very incomplete list of features describes what 
you can do with qME:
- Create new models from prefab components.
- Edit existing vertices and triangles of existing models.
- Paint on the model in 3D and in 2D.
- View and edit 3D texture mapped animations contained in MDL files.
- Create new animation frames.
- Import and export textures to a 256 colors windows BMP file. 
- Fit textures around the 3D model by adjusting 2D texture vertices.
- Create a hierarchy of interlinked objects for animation.

You can find MDL files in the PAK0.PAK and PAK1.PAK files that are 
part of Quake. Both files are distributed by id software. To open a 
PAK file use the tools that are freely available on the net.

5. Credits

Thanks to Smoke for making the first version of the tutorial and 
wOOpNgibs for doing most of the object library prefab objects.



6. Known Bugs and Limitations

There will probably be some bugs. Software is like that. But 
any such bugs will be addressed quickly when identified.
