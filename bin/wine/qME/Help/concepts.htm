<h1><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">Concepts</font></h1>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Before you start
modeling, you need to know a few modeling concepts that are very
specific to Quake.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Read this section
carefully, since it contains valuable tips and tricks that allow
you to successfully create a model for Quake.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Monsters perform a
number of actions. These actions are modeled as scenes. Scenes
are sequences of frames that sometimes are played in a continuous
loop like when a monster is running or standing. Sometimes a
scene is played once, like when a monster is dying.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In general
monsters have the following kinds of scenes :</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">stand :
        monster is standing, waiting for you to arrive.</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">walk :
        monster is walking around guarding an area.</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">run : monster
        is chasing you.</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">attack :
        monster is attacking you</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">pain :
        monster is having pain</font></li>
    <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">death :
        monster is dropping dead in some way</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Most monsters have
a variety of different attack, pain and death scenes, to make the
actions look a bit more realistic.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">It's amazing to
see with how little frames a run scene is animated. A soldier
that is running has a run scene of no more than 8 frames. The
reason for this is that scenes are played back with a fixed rate
of 10 frames per second. This would make a run scene of 8 frames
which depicts a soldier taking two steps take 0,8 seconds, which
is realistic for running. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">If you insert too
many frames into a fast action scene, it will look like a slow
motion replay. On the other hand sometimes you need to insert
more frames to make the animation go slower. For example to
prevent a standing monster from looking like it has a violent
shaking affliction, you need to insert a lot of frames. Assuming
the monster is looking around and turns its head every 10 seconds
or so, this would mean you'd need 100 frames to show that.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">For models like
torches that stay in one spot and that don't interact with the
players, you can turn the scene into a framegroup. A framegroup
is a special scene where you can specify a duration for every
frame. Framegroup animations are handled on the client side, you
might have noticed that during network play when the server stops
you still can see the torches burning. Well that is because the
animations are played on the client side.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The structure of
Quake models limits the things you can do in animations. There is
a single list of triangles for all the frames in the model. This
means that every frame must have the same number of vertices.
What you cannot do is for example let the monster swing an ax in
one scene and remove this ax in another scene. There is a trick
to workaround this limitation though. To make an object disappear
you need to scale down the object to a minuscule size and put it
inside the body of the monster. The original Quake models use
this trick very often.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">You can have more
than one skin in your model, but there is only a single list of
skin vertices that map the skins onto the 3D frames. This means
that all your skins need exactly the same layout and the same
size. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Objects and pivots
are concepts that are not originally found in Quake models, but
that are introduced by qME. An object is used to group vertices
and triangles in a model. For example a chainsaw is an object and
a monster's head can be an object etc.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">When importing an
original Quake model, the model is scanned for groups of
triangles that are separate from each other. These separate
groups of triangles are turned into separate objects. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Objects are
organized in a tree. At the root of the tree there is a root
object that has other objects as its children. Applying an
operation like scaling to the object will apply it automatically
to its child objects.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Pivots are kind of
like bones for your model. A pivot controls the position and
orientation and scale of the vertices in your object in a single
frame. Just like bones are attached to flesh in your body. Moving
a pivot means moving the object in that frame and thus the
vertices. For every object there is a pivot in every frame. This
means that when you have for example 10 frames and you have 3
objects, you have a total of 30 pivots. </font></p>
