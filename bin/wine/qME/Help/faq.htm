<p><a name="reconstruct all objects"><font size="4" face="Arial">Q</font><font
size="2" face="Arial"> What does reconstruct all objects mean ? </font></a></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">A</font><font size="2"
face="Arial"> What it does is throw away all the objects in your
model. It then scans all triangles in the model and puts
triangles that are attached to each other into the same object.
So every connected set of triangles becomes one single object.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="flood align triangles"><font size="4" face="Arial">Q</font><font
size="4"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">What is the function
of the &quot;flood align triangles&quot; operation ?</font></a></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">A </font><font size="2"
face="Arial">Flood align is used when you import a mesh from a
modeling program. Sometimes the triangles in such a mesh are not
all facing in the right direction. By using flood align you can
align (make it face the same way) all triangles in an object to
the triangle you selected.</font></p>

<p><a name="size of models explode"><font size="4" face="Arial">Q</font><font
size="4"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">I am editing some of
the MDLfiles, changing some artwork, then, in QMe, the </font></a><font
size="2" face="Arial">lightversion i add 2 objects and BWAM, from
around 300Kb it jumps to 1.7MB!! what the hell happened here? did
i do something wrong, i only added 2 spheres and resized them a
bit. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">A </font><font size="2"
face="Arial">qME will add a lot of information to the end of an
MDL file. To get rid of it use the &quot;Save as Quake
model&quot; opetation from the file menu. This will put your
model on a big diet. You will loose the qME specific data, like
the object hierarchy, joints and skin names though.</font></p>

<p><a name="mapping skins like id"><font size="4" face="Arial">Q </font><font
size="2" face="Arial">I have been having trouble making a skin
for my model. When I first put the model </font></a><font
size="2" face="Arial">together, the skin is just pieces of the
model lined up next to each other. I was wondering how it would
be possible to make the skin just like the id ones - just a front
and back picture - and to make the skin taller, so more can fit
in.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">A </font><font size="2"
face="Arial">With a lot of patience and the &quot;recalculate
skin vertices&quot; button you can get the result you want. Also
using the model properties editor you can set the skin size.</font></p>

who does some amazing modeling with Lightwave and uses qME for
importing.]</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I know this problem well, I get it
all the time, here is what you must do with lightwave. You must
have all seperate objects loaded in the same order. In other
words, If you are loading the objects up as sperate parts in
Lightwave's Modeler, and saveing them, you must always load them
in the same order that you did for the base frame, or you get
mangeled. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I recently tried to repostion the
old player model in Lightwave, when i reloaded him into Qme, he
was totaly mangeld. It is very anyoing, I have gotten around it
with a great plugin for Lightwave Called Load From Scene at </font><a
href="http://www.cadvision.com/ewertb/LoadFromScene.htm"><font
color="#0000FF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>http://www.cadvision.com/ewertb/LoadFromScene.htm</u></font></a><font
size="2" face="Arial"> Its only $12 U.S. It lets me animate in
Lightwave and then load each frame into modeler, then save them,
it loads up the objects in the same order each time so they can
be morhphed in Lightwave or in my case loaded corectly in Qme.
The only problem is it does not read the data from bones, so you
have to animate in seperate objects. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Your program [qME] rely's on
moving the points in each frame, so when a model is loaded it may
look the same but the points are in a different order, and your
program [qME] attaches them to the polys set in the base frame.
so while all the points look ok; the polys are attached to the
wrong points. So your main problem is that people are changing
the point order on your program, and its handeling it the best it
can. Hope there is a fix for this (maybe take the poly data from
each frame?) but I dont know. </font></p>

<p><a name="using different palettes"><font size="4" face="Arial">Q</font><font
size="2" face="Arial"> I loaded up my TC models with the new skin
and they are all messed up well any </font></a><font size="2"
face="Arial">way I figured it out it is that we are not using the
quake pallette so could you add a pallette import for the TC </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">A</font><font size="2"
face="Arial"> Put the palette.lmp and colormap.lmp you want to
use in the <strong>same</strong> directory as <strong>qme.exe</strong>
and these will be used instead of the original Quake palette. To
quickly switch between palettes, create a few copies of the
qme.exe in different base directories and put palette and
colormap files into these directories. Now starting a specific
qme.exe will load it with the correct palette.</font></p>

<p><a name="problems GL-Quake"><font size="4" face="Arial">Q<strong>
</strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial">We made some
weapon-models with qME v3.0 and have problems using them in
GL-Quake</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial"> because Quake
doesn't display them properly. So we want to know which
model-editor is the best to use for this ? (We've also tried
MeDLe and Advenced ModelED but they're c**p.)</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">A </font><font size="2"
face="Arial">I asked Bubbah, because I played Malice in GL-Quake
and the models looked fine, (fantastic is a better word for it).
It seems GL-Quake creates meshes for models when they are loaded
for the first time. If you later change the models, these meshes
no longer match the new models. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To solve this problem, delete the
meshes generated by GL-Quake. You can find these meshes for quake
models in the directory &quot;c:\quake\id1\glquake&quot; or when
you play a different game, let's say Malice in
&quot;c:\quake\malice\glquake\&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another problems with earlier 0.95
version of GL-Quake seems to be that client side skin animations
doesn't work. Now there were no client side skin animations in
Quake itself, but some TCs use them. Anyway, the upcoming 3.1
release of qME will have full support for creating client side
skin animations. I implemented a few weeks ago.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">Q </font><a
name="slow in highcolor"><font size="2" face="Arial">qME is very
slow on my 166mhz Pentium in high color mode</font></a><font
size="2" face="Arial">. What can I do about it ?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">A</font><font size="2"
face="Arial"> The biggest time consumer is the copying of the
rendered image to the display. You can get a dramatic speed
increase by setting the colordepth to 256 colors. qME has been
optimized to run in 256 color mode.</font></p>
