<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Quake has a very
open game architecture. It lets you change almost anything in the
game. Monsters, levels, sounds, even the game rules programmed
into the game can be changed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Monsters are
animated 3D polygon models that have a skin stretched onto them.
qME allows you to edit existing monsters or create new monsters
from scratch. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">qME is a one step
solution to building Quake monsters. You will be able to do every
aspect of building a Quake model; modeling, skin painting and
animation are all supported.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">When you create
models in qME, you usually start by inserting objects from a
library of prefab objects into your model, then paint skins and
create animation sequences. When saving the model, all
information needed by Quake is calculated and stored in your
model file. The file that is created by qME are read directly by
Quake.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">If you want to
create a model outside qME this is possible too. qME supports the
most important 3D file formats, allowing you to import from most
3D editors. It also supports the import of skins from the
clipboard or from a file so you can edit the skin in an external
editor too.</font></p>
